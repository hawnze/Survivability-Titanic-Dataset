# Survivability-Titanic-Dataset
Took a few courses on machine learning and data analysis on kaggle and was able to test my application of what I learned:
-  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing data by dropping rows, imputation
-   Data Exploration and Insights: learned to analyze the correlation between different features (e.g., Age, SibSp, Parch)
-  Feature Selection and Transformation: combined the train and test datasets into a single dataset (all_data) for preprocessing
-  Data Merging and Handling: such as combining the train and test datasets into a single dataset
This project has a heavier emphasis on data analysis and I was struggling a bit on understanding how to build the models in terms of machine learning so I still have much to learn
Not fully finished...
